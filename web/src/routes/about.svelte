    <p class="m-6 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-200 text-xl">
      Bleeps is the first Sound generated entirely from the evm. it uses the tokenURI standard directly like
      <a class="underline" href="https://mandalas.eth.limo">Mandalas.eth</a> pioneered, but for sound.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like <a class="underline" href="https://nouns.wtf">Nouns DAO</a>, Bleeps DAO utilizes a fork of Compound
      Governance and is its main governing body. The Bleep DAO treasury receives a percentage of the ETH proceeds from
      musicians auctions. Each Bleep is an irrevocable member of Bleeps DAO and entitled to one vote in all governance
      matters.
    </p>

    <p>
      Work is underway to generate more complex sounds called "Meldody" from the Bleeps. When a creator create it is put
      on sale on an auction where 5% of the proceed goes to the DAO and 5% more is shared among all bleeps used by the
      melody.
